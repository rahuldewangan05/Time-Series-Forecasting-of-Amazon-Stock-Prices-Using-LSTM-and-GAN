--- Summary of Model Evaluation ---
1. Traditional Models:
   - White Noise, Random Walk, AR, and ARMA models performed similarly on differenced log prices
   - ARIMA and SARIMA models had much higher errors when evaluated on log prices
   - AR and ARMA models were the best performing traditional models

2. Neural Network Models:
   - LSTM model significantly outperformed traditional models with an R² of 0.955541
   - GAN implementation was noted as complex for direct time series forecasting

3. Overall Best Model:
   - The best performing model was LSTM with:
     * MSE: 0.001620
     * RMSE: 0.040247
     * MAE: 0.032085
     * R²: 0.955541
